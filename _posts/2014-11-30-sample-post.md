title: Case Study - Bloc Jams
---

Bloc Jams was the first application project assigned to me by Bloc. Not unlike Spotify, Bloc Jams acts as a music player that sits right in your web browser. The initial build used HTML, CSS and Javascript, and in later iterations, JQuery and Angular. 

This project acted as a jumping off point of sorts for the second phase of Bloc's curriculum; taking skills aquired from the first phase -- HTML, CSS and Javascript, respectively -- and applying them to a real life situation.
