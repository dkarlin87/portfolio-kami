title: Case Study - Bloc Chat
---

Bloc Chat is an AngularJS-based web chat client. This project relied heavily on Angular and Firebase, and included the challenge of building a platform in which you can create new chat rooms and send messages. By far, this was the project I have had the hardest time with at this point in the curriculum, as AngularJS came off to me as convoluded and initially difficult to grasp. However, after time and seeking out extra learning resources, I became more versed in the framework and was able to complete the assignment.
