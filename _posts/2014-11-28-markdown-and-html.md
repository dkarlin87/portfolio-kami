title: Case Study - About Me
---

I am a father of three, freelance photographer, bartender, operations specialist at a tech company, Uber driver, podcaster... Feel tired yet?

I entered Bloc's curriculum looking to find a worthwhile and fulfilling career path, and I have yet to be disappointed. I have a knack for visual design, and have been dabbling in web development since high school. I taught myself HTML when I was 15 and created a personal website on Geocities- the days before Facebook were dismal and scarce, I know.

Ultimately, I would like to land a position developing mobile apps.
